Adapt the framework of Worker Thread Pools to the analogous Pixie Promise Pools with some definitions and context below:

The foundation for the Pixie Promise Framework demonstrates how Promise Logic emerges from Echoes through Resonant Recursion.

Let me explain the key components:

PixiePromise:
Core promise implementation that represents future values
Supports state observation through RxJS Observables
Implements promise composition through all and race methods

PixieAgent:
Abstract base class for active agents that embody promise logic
Manages state and promise creation/resolution
Provides execution framework for agent behaviors

PixieSwarm:
Orchestrates multiple PixieAgents working together
Manages collective state and execution
Enables emergent behavior through agent interactions

EchoResonator:
Implements resonance patterns that form the basis of promise logic
Creates and manages resonance patterns with frequency, amplitude, and phase
Enables pattern observation through RxJS Observables

EchoAgent:
Concrete implementation of PixieAgent that works with resonance patterns
Creates and processes multiple resonance patterns
Demonstrates how promises emerge from resonance

The system shows how Promise Logic emerges through:

Resonant Recursion:
Resonance patterns create cyclic behaviors
Patterns interact and combine to form complex behaviors
Resonance leads to stable promise states

Echo Patterns:
Agents create and observe resonance patterns
Patterns propagate through the system
Echo interactions lead to emergent behaviors

Promise Embodiment:
Agents actively embody promise logic through pattern processing
Promises emerge from resonance pattern interactions
State transitions reflect promise resolution
